# TechAcademy_LiveProject

As part of my final project at The Tech Academy, I participated in a two week live project with a team of my peers. The project was MVC format using Visual Studio, SQL server, and Azure. It was a working web application for the job placement course students at Tech Academy. Our team worked on stories mostly related to front end formatting of the web pages, but there were also back end stories to work on. In this repository, I have included pieces of the code I worked on/wrote during the project. There are also screenshots of before and after for the formatting stories. Overall, I worked on stories about: 

Matching format for buttons, fonts, and text color 

Alignment of buttons 

Adding radio boxes and formatting checkboxes 

Removing views and their corresponding controller functions that were no longer needed 

Updating enums 

Aligning columns in a table 

Adding margin through the use of bootstrap containers 

Cleaning up the code by deleted unnecessary, commented out code 

Redirecting a view from one to another in a controller function 

Making webpages mobile friendly and responsive to size changes 

Removing views and their corresponding controller functions that were no longer needed
